# API Design Task

## Considerations

For this type of database, we would be want there to be relationships between the databases. With that in mind, a relational SQL database has been implemented. 

Within this scenario, we assumed the dataset would be used within a made-up letting company where Owners could log in and access their house data, update/delete tenant information. Tenants could log in as well so they can update their information as well, incase they have moved on and now own a home or they want to alter other information on their profile.
