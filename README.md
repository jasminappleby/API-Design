# API Design Task

## Description and Considerations

Letting me move ltd. is a letting agency helping people with their moving needs.
The API has been created to facilitate the navigation and data management for the users of Letting me move ltd., employees and clients alike.
It is based on a relational database, thus the one implemented is using SQL.

## Schema

For our Schema Tables, we took a UNF to 3NF approach to create them. This enabled us to split up the data attributes within the database more logically. 

> Key: The top line is the header of the Schema Table. This will also be in bold. 
> PK = Primary Key
> FK = Foreign Key
